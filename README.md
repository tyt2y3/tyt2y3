### Founder @ SeaQL / Rust Engineer / Open Source Advocate

Hi! I am Chris, originally from Hong Kong, now living in the UK. I am a Rust Software Engineer. I am the founder of [SeaQL.org](//www.sea-ql.org), best known for developing [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SeaQL/sea-orm.svg?style=social).

### Life Story

Open source is my north star. I published my first computer [graphics library](https://github.com/tyt2y3/vaserenderer) on GitHub when I was 18 years old. At 27 years old, I quit my job and started [Vision Cortex](https://github.com/visioncortex), best known for developing [VTracer](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/visioncortex/vtracer.svg?style=social). Later I discovered a niche in the Rust ecosystem, so we pivoted and started working on SeaQL.

SeaQL won the [OpenUK Awards 2023](https://openuk.uk/awards/openuk-awards-2023/)[&nbsp;](https://openuk.uk/awards/openuk-awards-2024-fifth-edition/openuk-awards-2023/openuk-awards-2023-photo-gallery/) in the Software category.

### Mission

I believe in open-source software. Collaborating on open source development represents humanity’s most remarkable technological progress. Open-source encapsulates our collective wisdom and embodies our shared commitment to tackle problems beyond our individual capacities—whether those of a person or a company. It's the best thing we can leave for posterity.

Creating open-source software isn’t easy, and funding an organisation can be hard. I continue to search for better ways to fund, build and grow open-source projects, and to invite more people into this community.

### Faith vs Reality

Maintainer burnout is a real issue. As a maintainer I felt the grind everyday. I rely on a glimpse of hope in which the industry is becoming more supportive to community-driven open source (as opposed to corporate-driven); and that we can eventually stumble upon a way to make open source sustainable.

### Research Work

I am not in academia, but I am glad to have been cited for my work. My interest includes computer graphics, computational geometry, real-time programming, compilers / debuggers and software engineering techniques.
