### Founder @ SeaQL / Rust Engineer / Open Source Advocate

Hi! I am Chris, originally from Hong Kong, now living in the UK. I am a Rust Software Engineer. I am the founder of [SeaQL.org](//www.sea-ql.org), best known for developing [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SeaQL/sea-orm.svg?style=social). I am committed to open source and developer toolings, now focusing on [FireDBG](https://github.com/SeaQL/FireDBG.for.Rust) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SeaQL/FireDBG.for.Rust.svg?style=social). I am looking to meet potential co-founders who are also dedicated to improving developer experience.

### Life Story

Open source is my north star. I published my first computer [graphics library](https://github.com/tyt2y3/vaserenderer) on GitHub when I was 18 years old. At 27 years old, I quit my job and poured all the money I have and founded [Vision Cortex](https://github.com/visioncortex), best known for developing [VTracer](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/visioncortex/vtracer.svg?style=social). Later I discovered a niche in the Rust ecosystem, so we pivoted and started working on SeaQL.

### Mission

Programming is hard. It is absolutely mind-boggling when something goes wrong in production.
While 'observability' is now in nomenclature, how about 'debuggability'? What can we do to make debugging programs easier?

If you are curious and feeling the same, let's team up and embark on a journey to transform software engineering. We will build a product that serves every programmer in the world.

### Faith / Reality

Maintainer burnout is a real issue. As a maintainer I felt the grind everyday. I rely on a glimpse of hope in which the industry is becoming more supportive to community-driven open source (as opposed to corporate-driven); and that we can eventually stumble upon a way to make open source sustainable. Until then, we rely on faith.

### Research Work

I am not in academia, but I am glad to have been cited for my work. My interest includes computer graphics, computational geometry, real-time systems, compilers / debuggers and software engineering techniques.

### Sponsorship

My personal [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/tyt2y3) profile is up! You can sponsor my journey in search of a sustainable open source model. And probably we can have some good talks on Computer Science and Philosophy.
