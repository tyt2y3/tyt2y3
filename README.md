# Open Source Advocate

I am a strong believer in open source.

I started my GitHub journey 10 years ago, when I published my first [programming library](https://github.com/tyt2y3/vaserenderer).

Over the years, I founded these organizations and led the development of
[SeaQL](https://github.com/SeaQL) (known for [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm)),
[Vision Cortex](https://github.com/visioncortex) (known for [VTracer](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer)),
[Project F](https://github.com/Project-F) (known for [F.LF](https://github.com/Project-F/F.LF)):

    <tr>
      <td><a href="//www.sea-ql.org"><img src="https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/img/SeaQL%20badge.png" width="250"/></a></td>
      <td><a href="//www.visioncortex.org"><img src="https://www.visioncortex.org/public/visioncortex-icon-dual.svg" width="250"/></a></td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Each of these organizations has their own domain and philosophy, but they all share the same goal: to lay down a solid foundation for developers to experiment on new ideas and to develop better software.

Over the decade, I have exchanged ideas with many people across the internet, from different parts of the world.

I am trying to build a profitable company on top of sustainable open source projects.

If you share a common vision and want to work with me, please contact me immediately.

If you like what I do, consider starring, commenting, sharing and contributing.

Collaboration on open source is the best thing humanity ever had.
